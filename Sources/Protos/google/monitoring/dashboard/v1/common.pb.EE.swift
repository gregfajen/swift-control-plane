/// Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of
/// the data.  Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time
/// series in the set is _aligned_ to the same time interval boundaries, then the
/// set of time series is optionally _reduced_ in number.
///
/// Alignment consists of applying the `per_series_aligner` operation
/// to each time series after its data has been divided into regular
/// `alignment_period` time intervals. This process takes _all_ of the data
/// points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as
/// averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single
/// data point per period.
///
/// Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be
/// combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical
/// transformations. Reduction involves applying a `cross_series_reducer` to
/// all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with
/// `group_by_fields`, and applying the reducer to each subset.
///
/// The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from
/// multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into
/// a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example "the
/// 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster". This
/// representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the
/// individual time series data is still available for later drilldown. For more
/// details, see [Filtering and
